🚗 Power BI Project: Tata Motors Car Sales Dashboard (2022-2023)

I’ve created a 3-page interactive Power BI dashboard based on a simulated dataset of Tata Motors, focusing on 4 key car models — Nexon, Punch, Altroz, and Harrier. The dashboard showcases:

🔹 Car-wise Sales, Profit, Pre-orders & 

 🔹 Monthly Sales Trends & State-wise Performance
 
 🔹 Customer Ratings, Delivery Delays & City-wise Insights
 
 🔹 Real-time KPIs with dynamic DAX measures
 
Each page is dedicated to one car model with deep visual analysis and interactive filters.

 This project helped me improve my skills in data modeling, DAX functions, and real-world storytelling using Power BI.
📊 Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, CSV Dataset
